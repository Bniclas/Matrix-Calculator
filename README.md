# Information about the matrix calculator
Here is a short introduction into my matrix calculator and some basic information about this project.

## Why this calculator ?

The calculator is just a small project for me to come up with Java and try to bring math into Java.
I began the calculator in C but however I decided to shift the project to Java to create a simple GUI for other users as well as me
to make it easy and funny to work with this calculator.

I know that the calculator might not be perfect but it's just a simple project for me to learn Java.

## Where can I find any documentation of the files ?

The project is mainly scripted in Java. That's why you can find most of the documentation information in the java/documentation folder.

## How to use it ?

[Documentation]
If you need some documentation you find it in the java/documentation folder when opening the index.html file to get information about 
any specififc method or class.

[Code]
If you only want to study my code you can find it in the c/*.c folder as well as in the java/code/... folder.
You should know that the project probably is only going to be updated in Java.

[Use the calculator]
In the java-folder you can find a executable .jar file which you can download and execute.

Step-by-Step:
1. You create a matrix by telling the program how many rows and columns the new matrix should have.
2. You click on "Create"
3. You insert the numbers you want into the matrix (If you want to delete old numbers you have to mark the number and type a '-' or any number key
4. If you only want to do your calculations with a single matrix you can select the things you want and press on "Calculate"
5. Otherwise you can click on "Save" and save your matrix for later
6. Then you will see, that the selection-boxes will get a number when pressing on "Save" this means the matrix was saved with this number and you can
   show all saved matrices via the given button. Then you can select your matrices and make other calculations like multiply and so on.

Requirements to run the .jar file:
- [X] Java Runtime Environment
- [X] If you have installed the Java Development Kit, the JRE is installed automatically

## What is planned for the future ?
- [ ] Optimization for calculations
- [ ] Better GUI
- [ ] More languages
- [ ] Better documentation

## Showcases

I'm going to make things as easy as possible for users to use this calculator and work with it.

Here's a picture of how the calculator looks at the moment:
